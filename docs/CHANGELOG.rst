  ``resolwe/archiver`` Docker images
- **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE:** Remove obsolete processes: ``archiver``,
  ``upload-tab-file`` and ``upload-image-file``
- **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE:** Python process syntax has changed: all the
  attributes of Data object are now available in Python process and therefore
  accessing outputs using syntax ``data_object.output_name`` is no longer
  valid since ``output_name`` could be the name of the attribute. The new
  syntax is ``data_object.output.output_name``.

  and listener has changed from printing to stdout to sending messages over
  sockets. Messages printed to stdout or sent using old version of the
  ``resolwe-runtime-utils`` (YAML processes) are no longer processed. YAML
  processes need new version of ``resolwe-runtime-utils`` while Python
  processes require a rewrite to the new syntax and Python version 3.4 or
  higher in the container (``resolwe-runtime-utils`` package is no longer
  needed).

  on API endpoints
- **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE:** Remove filtering by ``year``, ``month``, ``day``,
  ``hour``, ``minute`` and ``second`` on API endpoints
- Migrate docker images to Fedora 31
- Use ``DictRelatedField`` for ``collection`` field in ``RelationSerializer``.
  In practice this fixes inconsistency comparing with how other serializers
  handle collections field.

Added
-----
- Support filtering by ``process_slug`` in ``DataViewSet``

- Fix access to subfields of empty ``GroupField`` in Python processes


===================
19.0.0 - 2019-08-20
===================

Changed
-------
- **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE:** Change relations between ``Data``, ``Entity`` and
  ``Collection`` from ``ManyToMany`` to ``ManyToOne``. In practice this means
  that ``Data.entity``, ``Data.colllecton`` and ``Entity.collection`` are now
  ``ForeignKey``-s. This also implies the following changes:

  - ``CollectionViewSet`` methods ``add_data`` and ``remove_data`` are removed
  - ``EntityViewset`` methods ``add_data``,``remove_data``,
    ``add_to_collection`` and ``remove_from_collection`` are removed
  - ``EntityQuerySet`` and ``Entity`` method ``duplicate`` argument
    ``inherit_collections`` is renamed to ``inherit_collection``.
  - ``EntityFilter`` FilterSet field ``collections`` is renamed to
    ``collection``.
- **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE:** Change following fields in ``DataSerializer``:

  - ``process_slug``, ``process_name``, ``process_type``,
    ``process_input_schema``, ``process_output_schema`` are removed and moved
    in ``process`` field which is now ``DictRelatedField`` that uses
    ``ProcessSerializer`` for representation
  - Remove ``entity_names`` and ``collection_names`` fields
  - add ``entity`` and ``colection`` fields which are ``DictRelatedField``-s
    that use corresponding serializers for representation
  - Remove support for ``hydrate_entities`` and ``hydrate_collections``
    query parameters
- **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE:** Remove ``data`` field in ``EntitySerializer``
  and ``CollectionSerializer``. This implies that parameter ``hydrate_data``
  is no longer supported.
- **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE:** Remove ``delete_content`` paremeter in ``delete``
  method of ``EntityViewset`` and ``CollectionViewSet``. From now on, when
  ``Entity``/``Collection`` is deleted, all it's objects are removed as well

- Add ``upload-dir`` process


===================
16.0.1 - 2019-04-29
===================

Fixed
-----
- Pin ``django-priority-batch`` to version ``1.1`` to fix compatibility issues


===================
16.0.0 - 2019-04-16
===================

Changed
-------
- **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE:** Access to DataField members (in Python process
  input) changed from dict to Python objects. For example,
  ``input_field.file_field['name']`` changed to
  ``input_field.file_field.path``.
- **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE:** Filters that are based on ``django-filter``
  ``FilterSet`` now use dict-declaring-syntax. This requires that subclasses
  of respective filters modify their syntax too.

14.3.0 - 2019-02-19
===================

Added
-----
- Add ``scheduled`` field to ``Data`` objects to store the date when object
  was dispatched to the scheduling system

===================

Added
-----
- Add ``input`` Jinja filter to access input fields

===================

Fixed
-----
- Make sure that tmp dir exists in Docker executor


===================
14.0.0 - 2018-12-17
===================

Changed
-------
- **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE:** Run data purge in a separate worker to make sure
  that listener replies to the executor within 60 seconds
- Use batcher for spawned processes in listener
- Increase Docker's memory limit for 100MB to make sure processes are not
  killed when using all available memory and tune Docker memory limits to
  avoid OOM.

Added
-----
- Raise an exception in Docker executor if container doesn't start for 60
  seconds
- Set ``TMPDIR`` environment variable in Docker executor to ``.tmp`` dir in
  data directory to prevent filling up container's local storage

- Clear cached Django settings from the manager's shared state on startup


===================
13.3.0 - 2018-11-20
===================

Changed
-------

- Add `tags` attribute to ``ProcessTestCase.run_process`` method which
  adds listed tag to the created ``Data`` object
- Copy ``Data`` objects tags from parent objects for spawned ``Data``
  objects and ``Data`` objects created by workflows

Fixed
-----
- Fix manager shutdown in the test runner. If an unrecoverable exception
  occurred while running a test, and never got caught (e.g. an unpicklable
  exception in a parallel test worker), the listener would not get terminated
  properly, leading to a hang.
- Data and collection name API filters were fixed to work as expected (ngrams
  was switched to raw).


===================
13.2.0 - 2018-10-23
===================

Added
-----
- Use prioritized batcher in listener

  to use Elasticsearch
- **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE:** Refactor ``Relation`` model, which includes:

  - renaming ``position`` to ``partition``
  - renaming ``label`` to ``category`` and making it required
  - adding ``unit``
  - making ``collection`` field required
  - requiring unique combination of ``collection`` and ``category``
  - renaming partition's ``position`` to ``label``
  - adding (integer) ``position`` to partition (used for sorting)
  - deleting ``Relation`` when the last ``Entity`` is removed

  command ``--path`` and ``--schemas``.
- Omit ``current_user_permissions`` field in serialization if only a subset of
  fields is requested
- Allow slug to be null on update to enable slug auto-generation
- Retire obsolete processes. We have added the ``is_active`` field to the
  Process model. The field is read-only on the API and can only be changed
  through Django ORM. Inactive processes can not be executed. The ``register``
  command was extended with the ``--retire`` flag that removes old process
  versions which do not have associated data. Then it finds the processes that
  have been registered but do not exist in the code anymore, and:

  - If they do not have data: removes them
  - If they have data: flags them not active (``is_active=False``)
