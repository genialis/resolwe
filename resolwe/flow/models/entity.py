class Relation(BaseModel):
    """Relations between entities.

    The Relation model defines the associations and dependencies between
    entities in a given collection:

    .. code-block:: json

        {
            "collection": "<collection_id>",
            "type": "comparison",
            "category": "case-control study",
            "entities": [
                {"enetity": "<entity1_id>", "label": "control"},
                {"enetity": "<entity2_id>", "label": "case"},
                {"enetity": "<entity3_id>", "label": "case"}
            ]
        }

    Relation ``type`` defines a specific set of associations among
    entities. It can be something like ``group``, ``comparison`` or
    ``series``. The relation ``type`` is an instance of
    :class:`.RelationType` and should be defined in any Django app that
    uses relations (e.g., as a fixture). Multiple relations of the same
    type are allowed on the collection.

    Relation ``category`` defines a specific use case. The relation
    category must be unique in a collection, so that users can
    distinguish between different relations. In the example above, we
    could add another ``comparison`` relation of ``category``, say
    ``Case-case study`` to compare ``<entity2>`` with ``<entity3>``.

    Relation is linked to :class:`resolwe.flow.models.Collection` to
    enable defining different relations structures in different
    collections. This also greatly speed up retrieving of relations, as
    they are envisioned to be mainly used on a collection level.

    ``unit`` defines units used in partitions where it is applicable,
    e.g. in relations of type ``series``.
